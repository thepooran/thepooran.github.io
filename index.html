            <p class="title-text">About me:</p>
            <p>
                Hi I'm <a href="#">Pooran</a> and I am founder CEO of <a href="#">C****soft, Inc.</a>,<br>
                And also a programmer, a graphic designer, a scientist and a star(of coruse).
            </p>
            <p>
                I love programming, so I am working on a vector based graphic editor which soon will be available <a href="#">free for everyone</a>. And also looking for <a href="#">programmers</a> interested to work on the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am very big fan of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank">Nikola Tesla</a>  because he invented the electric age and was a good ideal Human. I am also very big fan of great minds link
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_blank">Plato</a> because I love his philosophy and he is "The Philosopher"
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi" target="_blank">Rumi</a> because of his heart touching quotes,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh" target="_blank">Vincent van Gogh</a> because he was a marvolous painter and a true genius,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday" target="_blank">Micheal Faraday</a> because why not,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" target="_blank">Erwin Schrödinger</a> because of his thought experiment known as "Schrödinger's Cat",
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham">Ibn al Haytham</a> because he believed something I also believe about believing the truth,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man" target="_blank">Iron Man</a> because he's cool like me(ya i'm serious about this)
                and all those who want nothing but good for mankind.
            <p>
                I stay away from religious and patriotic people because I'm not one of them and I'm planing to write a book on it to
                show the truth to the world but I really like those who think <a href="">good of this world</a> and consider every being equal and those who belive in <a href="">God</a> because as one of my very good friend <a href="#">Tirth</a> said once, "There is huge difference between believing in <a href="">God</a> and being religious". And also I like my firends(who doesn't?)<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="title-text">And some quotes:</p>
            <p>
                "My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists."
                <h4 class="right-most">— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank">Nikola Tesla</a></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                “Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of of its content, attack it from every side. he should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.”
                <h4 class="right-most">― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham" target="_blank">Ibn al-Haytham</a></h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Those who want success so badly will get it, no matter what and those who don't will somehow manage to make excuses. And that's all I know."
